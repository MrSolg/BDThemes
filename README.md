Themes I've made for BetterDiscord using CSS

I made this as a "You can do cool things without knowing very much about a language" proof of concept. I've never touched CSS much before this, and my website is based off w3 styling. I'll take notes and advice from others on how to optimize and improve these themes, but feel free to use this as a reference. Please leave a little something in your code if I've helped you. DM me on Discord @ Whitewater#3436 if you have any questions, concerns, good baking recipes or advice.
